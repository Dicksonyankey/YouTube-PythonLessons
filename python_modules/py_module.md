**What is a module ?**

A module allows us to organize Python code in a systematic manner. It can be considered as a file consisting of Python code. A module can define functions, classes and variables.Therefore, in order to write a longer program, we might consider switching to a text editor to prepare an input for the interpreter and running it with that file as an input instead. This is known as writing a `script`.


To support this, Python has a way to put a code definition in a file and use them in another script or directly in an interactive instance of the interpreter. Such a file is called a `module`;

**Note**: When we import the module named `math_operations`, the interpreter first searches for a built-in module with that name. If not found, it then searches for a file named `math_operations`.py in a list of directories given by the variables system path.
Apart from this, Python has a large set of built-in modules known as the Python Standard Library.

# -----------   Tuples in python -----------

# Tuples are immutable and fixed size, Python allocates just the minimum memory block required for the data. As a result, tuples are more memory efficient than the lists.

# --------- How to create a tuple -----------
# tuples are created using the parenthesis () and each element or item is separated by comma.
# let's create 




# -------- The difference between tuple and list -----------
# the lists are mutable, Python needs to allocate an extra memory block in case there is a need to extend the size of the list object after it is created. However tuples are immutable and are fixed. if the are initialized and created, elements in the tuple can not be altered or changed.

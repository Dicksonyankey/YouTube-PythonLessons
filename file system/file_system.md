# Python file System
Files could be of many types, for example, text files with `.txt` extensions, data files in a `.csv` extension, or even executable files with `.exe` extensions.

Not all file types are immediately readable. Some file types are  requires specialized software to read themlike the `PSD` file that's generated by Adobe Photoshop.

In our tutorials we will be working with extensions such as `.txt, .csv and .json` that's Text file, comma separated value and javascript object notation respectively.


### **File Object** 

The file object is the default and easiest way to manipulate files in Python. It includes a couple of methods and attributes which make it easier for developers to read from, and write to, files in the filesystem. 

There are two major file object types that are recognized in Python: 
1. `Binary file objects`: These can read and write byte-like objects.
2. `Text file objects`: These can read and write strings objects.


### **The open function**
The `open()` function, which we will be looking at later, is the easiest way to create a file object. Depending on the mode passed to the open() function, you will get back either a binary or text file object.


### The file object methods
The file object has several methods to make it easy to work with the underlying file. They include the following: 
1. **file.read()**: This method loads the entire file into memory. 
2. **file.readline()**: This method reads a single line from the file into memory. 
3. **file.readlines()**: This method reads all of the lines of a file into a list. 
4. **file.write()**: This method writes output to the file. 
5. **file.seek()**: This method is used to move the file object position to a certain location in the file.
